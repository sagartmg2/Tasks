just like string, number, boolean, null and undefined, OBJECTS are another form of data-type

unlike string, numbers a single object can have lots of other values inside it in the form of keys and values pair


eg: i want to store  name, hexValue and RGB value for color red

    but we cannot code as below
    let color = "red","#FF000","rgb(255,0,0)"  // wrong code


    instead we can create an object for our red color
    eg: let color = {
        name:"red",
        hexValue:"#FF0000",
        rgbValue:"rgba(255,0,0)"
    }
